								<span class="image main"><img src="images/viaggio.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>1995-2017 - Padova</h4>
								<p>I lived in Padova until the age of 22. I've been always good at math and I loved probability. Thus, I decided to enroll in the <b><a href="https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/">Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the University of Padova</a></b>. During the university, I developed my passion for computational statistics and computer science. Thus, I chose to attend the <b><a href="https://datascience.math.unipd.it/">Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Padova</a></b>. To support my studies, I was a football referee for the Italian Football Federation. During this period, had my first internship at <b><a href="https://www.dianacorp.com/">Diana.corp</a></b>. Diana is a start-up that manages and promotes e-commerce for luxe fashion brands. My parents house is on the foot of the <i>Colli Euganei</i> hills. I loved to clymb the hills with my bicycle.</p>
								<h4>2018 - Helsinki</h4>
								<p>In the second and last year of my Master, I attended the courses for the <b><a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/degree-programmes/data-science-masters-programme">Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Helsinki</a></b>. This experience has been a life changer. It was the first time I lived myself. I had the bliss to meet fantastic people that introduced me to the self-development world. Moreover, I started to appreciate saunas and cold baths.</p>
								<h4>2019-2020 - Rome</h4>
								<p>I moved to Rome to join <b><a href="https://www.bip-group.com/en-uk/">BIP</a></b>, a big Italian consulting firm. BIP gave me the opportunity to work for huge corporates operating in telco and public administration. I worked with outstanding colleagues who teach me how data science projects are managed and deployed. During this period, I developed my passion for art. In my spare time, I was a volunteer for international students in Rome.</p>
								<h4>2020-2022 - Berlin</h4>
								<p>Rome is beautiful but messy and not so international. The desire to live and work in an international environment was bubbling in my stomach. When I saw that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-giovanni-busetto/">Alberto Busetto</a> was assembling a global data science team to support the digitalization of <b><a href="https://www.adeccogroup.com/">The Adecco Group</a></b>. I grabbed the opportunity. I moved in November 2022. Moving abroad during the biggest covid wave was not a piece of cake. I was forced to self-isolate for more than a month. Moreover, I had no clue when I could go back to visit my family. Meanwhile, I had to go through the required paperwork to establish myself in Germany. Luckily my colleagues at the Adecco were extremely supportive and the job transition was smooth. Moving abroad long term is not as easy as doing an Erasmus. You have to deal with bureaucracy (I had nightmares figuring out my tax duties) and you have to be conscious and proactive to make new friends. Berlin, however, is a melting pot with a unique vibe. The majority of the population is formed by young "free" expats. Everything is tolerated. Nothing is weird. I got in contact with outstanding people with fascinating ideas. Berlin helped me to expand my self-awareness. </p>
								<h4>2022-<i>Now</i> - Prague</h4>
								<p>In May 2022, I turned my life upside down by moving to Prague. I moved because I wanted to fully get in the game with a new life. It was a bold move. <i>Audentes Fortuna iuvat</i>, fortune favors the bold. Let's see what fate will bring to me. I still have to grasp the soul of Prague. What I like most is the <i>Multisport card</i>. A card that lets you go to hundreds of different gyms and gives you the possibility to try for free different types of sports. I got passionate about climbing. Moreover, I restarted my sauna/cold bath routine.</p>

								<p>The Adecco Group is the world's second-largest <b>Human Resources</b> provider and temporary staffing firm. It is a <b>Fortune 500 firm</b>. I'm part of the global data and AI team. The team is responsible to deliver data-driven digital solutions at scale in different countries. I'm part of the matching project. The aim of the project is to provide a semantic engine that can help recruiters to fill orders and candidates to find jobs.  
									In particular, I'm responsible for designing and developing the ontology of the skills and job titles. The ontology is used to normalize and associate skills and job titles.
									The ontology is based both on <b>NLP</b> and <b>graph theory</b>. The service is available through a scalable API.
									In 2022 the matching service was rolled out in the LHH app in the US. Compared to the previous matching solution, it almost <b>doubled the conversion rate</b> of candidates searching for a job in the app. Generating an <b>estimated impact of tens of thousands of Euros</b> in a 4 months. The challenge for 2023 is adoption in other languages and business units.

								<h3>Places with a soul</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A46EZjtDCQ9KbRz96">Giardino degli aranci</a></b> - Rome 🇮🇹<br>
										Best place to enjoy the sunset in Rome. Usually, some street artist plays melancholy songs. Great vibes, great memories.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FXM7pRQzPxC1nyiF6">Musei Vaticani</a></b> - Rome 🇮🇹<br>
										Mainstream. But I have to mention it. I bet you think the three homosexual kisses in the Sixtine chapel. It's quite hilarious that in the place where the Pope is elected three homosexual kisses are depicted, isn't it?
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/g7Jkt8bSXQ6LYKem7">Galleria Borghese</a></b> - Rome 🇮🇹<br>
										Get amazed by Benini and Caravaggio masterpieces. Do you know that Caravaggio portrayed himself as the head of Golia defeated by David?
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dVpUGTf8zeQmvo79A">Via Dei Tribunali</a></b> - Naples 🇮🇹<br>
										The soul of Naples. Street food and great pizzerias, mixed with the motorcycles' noises. An amazing mix of craziness and culiary art.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RCc2GV3hteZ8ex947">Sentiero degli Dei</a></b> - Naples 🇮🇹<br>
										The best hiking trail I have ever done. I did it on the 31st of December at 20 degrees. We start from the top of the mountain, admiring the Costiera Amafitana. We ended up with a well-deserved bath in Positano.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dCfMSuPDU7Cv36BbA">Maretimo</a></b> - Sicily 🇮🇹<br>
										The dolomites of Sicily. It is a little island, not super touristic with great hiking trails, crystal blue water, and delicious Sicilian food.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dCfMSuPDU7Cv36BbA">Tre cime di lavaredo</a></b> - Veneto 🇮🇹<br>
										The most beautiful mountains I've ever seen. It seems to be on another planet.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ghUfdBrHQCdQurYNA">Pico</a></b> - Azores 🇵🇹<br>
										A little island in the middle of the ocean. The island is famous for its wine and its volcano. It is 2.351m tall, and it is the tallest pick in Portugal. The island is basically composed only of this huge mountain. Its pick is covered by clouds most of the time. It looks like they want to hug him. I suggest climbing the volcano in the morning to see the sunrise from the top.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VdQygQbGn44BcEmf8">Sagres</a></b> - Algarve 🇵🇹<br>
										The chin of Portugal. Today, it is a small surfers' village. It was the last piece of land that many sailors saw before approaching the Atlantic Ocean. It looks like a cruise place. Always windy. It has a unique, nostalgic wild vibe.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oZejmFR9UrGyyEny6">Teufelsberg</a></b> - Berlin 🇩🇪<br>
										On top of the "hill of hell", a hill constituted by the ruins of the building destroyed by the 2nd war world. You can admire an abandoned military cover by hipster street art. It is a representation of Berlin's history.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BmpZBopVPHZdL8X68">MauerPark</a></b> - Berlin 🇩🇪<br>
										Flea Market and random live music. Full of Berliner lay down with a beer. This place holds the soul of Berlin
									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BmpZBopVPHZdL8X68">Hermitage Museum</a></b> - San Petersburg 🇷🇺<br>

									</li>
									<li>
										<b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mgQhZxxjHYTdomuZ9">Kuusijarvi</a></b> - Helsinki 🇫🇮<br>
										Best sauna of my life. It is a Finnish smoke sauna. Right outside the sauna, you can dip your toes into lake. I was there in January with -20 degree. The lake was frosen, the cold bath unique.
